In an 8-bit pixel, the possible colors are 256 colors, from 0 (0000 0000) to 255 (1111 1111). On a 7-bit pixel, the possible colors are 128 colors, from 0 (000 0000) to 127 (111 1111). The possible color is obtained from the power of 2 the number of bits. If it is 7 bits, then the number of colors\n",

Examples of color pixels 0 and 1 at 8-bit, represented by color 0 at 7-bit. color pixels 2 and 3 at 8-bit, represented by color 1 at 7-bit, etc"
